Info For Modders

Incorporate your mod into the Community Tech Tree is via noninvasive ModuleManager patches!
Simply create an empty .cfg file to be packaged with your mod (call it anything you like, I suggest CTTPatch.cfg), and include entries as follows:

@PART[panel-static01]:NEEDS[CommunityTechTree]
{
	@TechRequired = advSolarTech
}

This assigns the part "panel-static01" to the Advanced Solar Tech (advSolarTech) node, and will only run in the presence of the Community Tech Tree.

In addition, you need to provide a second ModuleManager patch (inside the same file) to unhide the tech nodes you wish to use, as well as any that are required to get to that node. 

For example, if you wanted to place an engine in Colossal Rocketry, you would need to unhide Experimental Rocketry, Gigantic Rocketry AND Colossal Rocketry. This is done as follows:

@TechTree:AFTER[CommunityTechTree]
{
	@RDNode:HAS[#id[experimentalRocketry]]
	{
		@hideEmpty = False
	}
	@RDNode:HAS[#id[giganticRocketry]]
	{
		@hideEmpty = False
	}
	@RDNode:HAS[#id[colossalRocketry]]
	{
		@hideEmpty = False
	}
}


The following is a list of all the new nodes in the Community Tech Tree, and the names by which they should be identified in the TechRequired field.




Happy researching!
